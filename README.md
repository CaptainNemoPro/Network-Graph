<h1># Network Graph Visualization with Plotly</h1>

This Python script generates a network graph using Plotly library. It creates a random geometric graph using NetworkX and visualizes it using Plotly's graph_objects module.

<h3>## Prerequisites</h3>
- Python 3.x
- Plotly
- NetworkX

<h3>## Installation</h3>
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:


<h3>## Usage</h3>
1. Run the script using Python:
2. The script generates a network graph and opens it in your default web browser.

<h3>## Description</h3>
- The script generates a random geometric graph with 200 nodes and edge probability 0.125 using NetworkX.
- It then extracts the edge and node coordinates from the graph and plots them using Plotly's Scatter plot.
- Nodes are represented as markers with color and size indicating the number of connections.
- Edges are represented as lines connecting the nodes.
- Hovering over nodes displays the number of connections.

- This script was created by Harshit Jain.
